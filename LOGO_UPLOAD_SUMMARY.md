# Logo Upload Feature - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

I've successfully implemented the Logo Upload feature for Suite Business, allowing users to upload and manage their business logos directly from the site preview interface.

### Key Components

1. **LogoUpload Component** (`/components/LogoUpload.tsx`)
   - Clean dialog interface with drag-and-drop support
   - Real-time preview of uploaded logos
   - File validation (type and size)
   - Easy removal option

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/sites/upload-logo/route.ts` - Handles file upload and storage
   - `/api/sites/[siteId]/update-logo/route.ts` - Updates database records

3. **File Storage**
   - Created `/public/uploads/logos/` directory structure
   - Implemented proper .gitignore rules
   - Files named with pattern: `{subdomain}-{timestamp}.{extension}`

4. **UI Integration**
   - Added "Logo" button to PreviewBar component
   - Logo displays in both preview and live site headers
   - Graceful fallback to business name when no logo exists

### Technical Specifications

- **Supported formats**: PNG, JPG, SVG, WebP
- **Max file size**: 5MB
- **Storage**: Local file system in `/public/uploads/logos/`
- **Display size**: 32px height (Tailwind's h-8 class)

### Code Quality

Following CLAUDE.md strictly:
- ✅ **ZERO technical debt** - Clean, maintainable implementation
- ✅ **No console.log** - All logging uses `/lib/logger.ts`
- ✅ **Native fetch** - No external HTTP libraries
- ✅ **Error handling** - All edge cases covered with user feedback
- ✅ **Multi-tenant isolation** - Site ownership verified
- ✅ **TypeScript** - Full type safety throughout

### User Experience

1. Click "Logo" button in preview bar
2. Drag-drop or select image file
3. See instant preview
4. Automatic save on dialog close
5. Remove option with confirmation

### Security

- Authentication required for all operations
- Site ownership verification
- File type and size validation
- Secure file naming to prevent conflicts

### Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation at `/docs/LOGO_UPLOAD.md` covering:
- Implementation details
- Usage instructions
- Technical specifications
- Future enhancement ideas

## Next Steps

The Logo Upload feature is now complete and ready for use. The implementation maintains the high code quality standards set by the project and integrates seamlessly with the existing preview and editing workflows.

Other priority features that can be implemented next:
- Enhanced Lead Capture Forms
- Stripe Billing Integration
- Email Marketing System

The logo upload feature enhances the site customization capabilities and provides a professional touch to the generated business websites.
