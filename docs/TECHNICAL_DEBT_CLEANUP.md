# Technical Debt Cleanup - December 2024

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Centralized Logging System
- Created `/lib/logger.ts` - A comprehensive logging utility that replaces all console statements
- Features:
  - Environment-aware logging (development vs production)
  - Structured logging with context and metadata
  - Specialized methods for API errors, auth errors, and integration errors
  - Log level filtering (debug, info, warn, error)

### 2. User Feedback System
- Created `/lib/toast.ts` - Toast notification system for user feedback
- Integrated `sonner` library for rich toast notifications
- Added common error patterns (auth, network, validation, rate limit)
- Updated root layout to include the Toaster component

### 3. Console Statement Replacement
Replaced all console.log/error/warn statements across the codebase:

#### Auth Pages
- `/app/auth/signup/page.tsx` - Added error toasts for failed signups
- `/app/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Already clean

#### API Routes
- `/app/api/business-search/route.ts` - Replaced with logger.apiError
- `/app/api/sites/create/route.ts` - Replaced with logger.integrationError

#### Library Files
- `/lib/google-business-profile.ts` - Replaced all console statements with appropriate logger methods
- `/lib/ghl.ts` - Replaced all console statements with logger.integrationError
- `/lib/subdomains.ts` - Replaced console.warn with logger.warn

#### UI Components
- `/app/onboarding/page.tsx` - Added success/error toasts for user feedback

### 4. Error Handling Improvements
- All errors now properly logged with context
- User-facing errors show appropriate toast messages
- Integration errors tracked separately for debugging
- API errors include endpoint information

### 5. Dependencies Added
- `sonner@^1.7.3` - Modern toast notification library

## Benefits
1. **Better Debugging**: Structured logs with context make debugging easier
2. **User Experience**: Clear feedback for all user actions
3. **Production Ready**: Proper logging that can be sent to external services
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized error handling and user feedback
5. **Zero Console Statements**: All console usage replaced with proper logging

## Next Steps
1. Configure production logging service (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
2. Add more specific error recovery strategies
3. Implement log aggregation for monitoring
4. Add user preference for toast position/duration
