## Overview

Suite Business offers flexible onboarding paths to accommodate both businesses with existing Google Business Profiles and those starting from scratch. The onboarding flow automatically creates websites, sets up GoHighLevel CRM integration, and configures industry-specific features.

## Onboarding Paths

### Path 1: With Google Business Profile (Recommended)
For businesses that already have a Google Business Profile listing.

**Flow:**
1. User signs in with Google
2. System checks for Google Business Profile access
3. User searches for or selects their business
4. Business data is imported automatically
5. Industry is detected and confirmed
6. Site is generated with rich content
7. GoHighLevel sub-account is created
8. User can preview and customize before publishing

### Path 2: Without Google Business Profile
For businesses starting fresh or preferring manual setup.

**Flow:**
1. User signs in with Google
2. Selects "Set up manually" option
3. Enters business information:
   - Business name
   - Industry selection
   - Contact information
   - Business hours
   - Services offered
4. Site is created immediately
5. GoHighLevel sub-account is created
6. Option to add GBP later from dashboard
