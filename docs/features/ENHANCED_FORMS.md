# Enhanced Lead Capture Forms Documentation

## Overview

The Enhanced Lead Capture Forms feature allows users to create and manage custom forms for their sites. This feature goes beyond the basic contact form by providing a form builder interface, multiple form types, and comprehensive submission management.

   - Drag-and-drop field management
   - Multiple field types (text, email, phone, textarea, select, radio, checkbox, date, time)
   - Field validation and requirements
   - Custom placeholder text
   - Conditional logic (future enhancement)

2. **Form Types**
   - Contact Form - Basic contact information
   - Quote Request - Service quotes with project details
   - Appointment Booking - Schedule appointments with date/time selection
   - Newsletter Signup - Email subscription forms

3. **Form Management**
   - Enable/disable forms without deletion
   - View submission counts
   - Edit existing forms
   - Delete forms (with confirmation)

4. **Submission Handling**
   - Automatic GoHighLevel sync (when enabled)
   - Email notifications (optional)
   - Submission tracking with metadata
   - Export to CSV
   - Bulk deletion

5. **Smart Form Integration**
   - Automatic form selection based on type
   - Fallback to default ContactForm
   - Seamless integration with existing site sections

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

Two new models were added to the Prisma schema:

```prisma
model Form {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  siteId      String
  name        String
  type        String   // 'contact', 'quote', 'appointment', 'newsletter'
  fields      Json     // Array of field definitions
  settings    Json?    // Form settings (notifications, redirects, etc)
  enabled     Boolean  @default(true)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  
  site        Site     @relation(fields: [siteId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  submissions FormSubmission[]
  
  @@index([siteId, type])
}

model FormSubmission {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  formId      String
  siteId      String
  data        Json     // Submitted form data
  metadata    Json?    // IP, user agent, referrer, etc
  ghlContactId String? // GoHighLevel contact ID if synced
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  
  form        Form     @relation(fields: [formId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  
  @@index([formId, createdAt])
  @@index([siteId, createdAt])
}
```

### Components

1. **FormsManager** (`/app/(app)/dashboard/forms/FormsManager.tsx`)
   - Main dashboard component for form management
   - Site selector for multi-site users
   - Form grid with actions

2. **FormBuilder** (`/app/(app)/dashboard/forms/FormBuilder.tsx`)
   - Form creation and editing interface
   - Field management with drag-and-drop
   - Settings configuration

3. **DynamicForm** (`/components/forms/DynamicForm.tsx`)
   - Renders forms based on configuration
   - Handles all field types
   - Form submission logic

4. **SmartForm** (`/components/forms/SmartForm.tsx`)
   - Intelligent form selector
   - Falls back to default ContactForm
   - Seamless integration

5. **SubmissionsViewer** (`/app/(app)/dashboard/forms/[formId]/submissions/SubmissionsViewer.tsx`)
   - View and manage form submissions
   - Export to CSV
   - Bulk operations

### API Endpoints

1. **Forms Management**
   - `GET /api/forms` - List forms (with public access for enabled forms)
   - `POST /api/forms` - Create new form
   - `GET /api/forms/[formId]` - Get single form
   - `PUT /api/forms/[formId]` - Update form
   - `DELETE /api/forms/[formId]` - Delete form
   - `PATCH /api/forms/[formId]/toggle` - Enable/disable form

2. **Submissions**
   - `POST /api/forms/submit` - Submit form (public endpoint)
   - `POST /api/forms/submissions/delete` - Delete submissions

## Usage Guide

### Creating a Form

1. Navigate to Dashboard > Forms
2. Select the site for the form
3. Click "Create New Form"
4. Choose form type (contact, quote, appointment, newsletter)
5. Configure fields:
   - Add/remove fields
   - Set field types and labels
   - Mark required fields
   - Add options for select/radio/checkbox fields
6. Configure settings:
   - Submit button text
   - Success message
   - Email notifications
   - GoHighLevel sync
7. Save the form

### Managing Forms

- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle form availability without deletion
- **Edit**: Modify form fields and settings
- **View Submissions**: Access submission data
- **Delete**: Remove form and all submissions

### Viewing Submissions

1. Click "View" on any form
2. Browse submissions with full details
3. Export to CSV for analysis
4. Delete individual or bulk submissions
5. Check GoHighLevel sync status

### Integration with Sites

Forms automatically integrate with sites:
- Contact sections use SmartForm component
- SmartForm checks for custom forms
- Falls back to default ContactForm if none exist
- Seamless user experience

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Form management requires user authentication
2. **Authorization**: Users can only manage forms for their own sites
3. **Public Access**: Form submission is public but validated
4. **Multi-tenant Isolation**: Forms are strictly isolated by site
5. **Data Validation**: All submissions are validated server-side

## GoHighLevel Integration

When GoHighLevel sync is enabled:
1. Form submissions automatically create/update contacts
2. Custom fields are mapped to GHL fields
3. Form type is tagged in GHL
4. Submission source is tracked
5. Contact ID is stored for reference

## Future Enhancements

1. **Conditional Logic**: Show/hide fields based on values
2. **Multi-step Forms**: Break long forms into steps
3. **File Uploads**: Support for document/image uploads
4. **Custom Validation**: Regex patterns and custom rules
5. **A/B Testing**: Test different form variations
6. **Analytics Dashboard**: Conversion rates and insights
7. **Webhook Integration**: Send data to external services
8. **Form Templates**: Pre-built forms for common use cases
9. **Spam Protection**: reCAPTCHA or honeypot fields
10. **Autosave**: Save progress for long forms
