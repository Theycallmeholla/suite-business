# Testing Coverage Report - Sitebango

**Created**: June 25, 2025, 2:00 AM CST

## Executive Summary

The Sitebango codebase has a **partial testing infrastructure** with significant gaps that need to be addressed before production launch. While test configuration and structure are in place, actual test coverage is minimal with many tests failing or not implemented.

## Current Testing Infrastructure

### 1. Test Frameworks Configured
- **Unit/Integration Testing**: Jest v30 with TypeScript support
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright v1.53.1
- **Testing Libraries**: 
  - @testing-library/react v16.3.0
  - @testing-library/jest-dom v6.6.3
  - @testing-library/user-event v14.6.1

### 2. Test Configuration Files
- ✅ `jest.config.ts` - Properly configured with Next.js integration
- ✅ `jest.setup.ts` - Comprehensive mocking setup
- ✅ `playwright.config.ts` - Multi-browser E2E configuration
- ❌ `.eslintrc` - Missing
- ❌ `.prettierrc` - Missing
- ❌ CI/CD workflows - No GitHub Actions or similar

### 3. Test File Inventory

#### Unit/Integration Tests (6 files)
1. `__tests__/auth/authentication.test.tsx` - **FAILING** (mock issues)
2. `__tests__/tenant/multi-tenant-isolation.test.ts` - **PASSING** (10 tests)
3. `__tests__/integration/ghl-integration.test.ts` - Status unknown
4. `__tests__/integration/gbp-integration.test.ts` - Status unknown
5. `__tests__/integration/website-generation-orchestration.test.ts` - Complex, likely failing
6. `__tests__/api/ghl-webhook.test.ts` - **FAILING** (Request not defined)

#### E2E Tests (2 files)
1. `e2e/onboarding.spec.ts` - Comprehensive onboarding flow
2. `e2e/auth-flow.spec.ts` - Authentication and subdomain routing

### 4. Test Coverage Analysis

#### ✅ Areas with Some Test Coverage:
- Multi-tenant data isolation (PASSING)
- Basic authentication flows (tests exist but failing)
- GHL webhook handling (tests exist but failing)
- Google Business Profile integration (tests exist, status unknown)

#### ❌ Critical Areas WITHOUT Test Coverage:
1. **Intelligent Content Generation System** - No tests for:
   - Smart question components (TinderSwipe, ThisOrThat, etc.)
   - Data scoring algorithm
   - Content generation engine
   - Template adaptation system

2. **Core Business Logic** - No tests for:
   - Site creation and management
   - Custom domain handling
   - Billing and subscription management
   - Form builder and submissions
   - Analytics tracking
   - SEO schema generation

3. **API Endpoints** - Limited coverage:
   - Only GHL webhook tested (and failing)
   - No tests for 40+ other API routes

4. **UI Components** - No component tests:
   - Dashboard components
   - Site section components
   - Form components
   - Admin panel

5. **Database Operations** - No tests for:
   - Prisma queries
   - Transaction handling
   - Data migrations

6. **External Integrations** - Partial coverage:
   - Stripe integration - NO TESTS
   - Email service - NO TESTS
   - OpenAI integration - NO TESTS
   - Google Maps/Places API - NO TESTS

### 5. Test Execution Status

```bash
# Results from test runs:
- Multi-tenant tests: 10/10 PASSING ✅
- Authentication tests: 0/6 PASSING ❌ (TypeError in mocks)
- GHL webhook tests: 0/? PASSING ❌ (ReferenceError: Request not defined)
- Other tests: NOT EXECUTED
```

### 6. Mock Infrastructure

**Well-configured mocks in jest.setup.ts:**
- ✅ Next.js navigation
- ✅ NextAuth
- ✅ Prisma client
- ✅ Logger
- ✅ Email service
- ✅ Google Business Profile
- ✅ GoHighLevel
- ✅ Subdomain utilities
- ✅ Window.matchMedia
- ✅ NextRequest/NextResponse

**Issue**: Mocks are configured but not properly utilized in failing tests

## Critical Gaps & Risks

### 1. **High-Risk Areas Without Tests**
- Payment processing (Stripe)
- User authentication and authorization
- Data security and isolation
- Content generation reliability
- API rate limiting and error handling

### 2. **Integration Testing Gaps**
- No end-to-end flow tests for complete user journeys
- No tests for third-party API failures
- No tests for webhook reliability
- No tests for background job processing

### 3. **Performance & Load Testing**
- No performance benchmarks
- No load testing for multi-tenant scenarios
- No database query optimization tests

### 4. **Security Testing**
- No tests for SQL injection prevention
- No tests for XSS protection
- No tests for authentication bypass attempts
- No tests for tenant data leakage

## Recommendations for Pre-Launch Testing

### Phase 1: Fix Existing Tests (1-2 days)
1. Fix authentication test mocking issues
2. Fix GHL webhook test Request/NextRequest issues
3. Ensure all existing tests pass
4. Add missing test utilities and helpers

### Phase 2: Critical Path Coverage (3-5 days)
1. **User Authentication Flow**
   - Sign up with Google
   - Sign in/out
   - Session management
   - Protected route access

2. **Business Onboarding**
   - GBP import flow
   - Manual setup flow
   - Site generation
   - Domain setup

3. **Payment Processing**
   - Subscription creation
   - Payment failures
   - Webhook handling
   - Usage limits

4. **Core Features**
   - Form submissions
   - Lead management
   - Site customization
   - Analytics tracking

### Phase 3: Integration & E2E Tests (2-3 days)
1. Complete user journey tests
2. Third-party API failure scenarios
3. Multi-tenant isolation verification
4. Performance benchmarks

### Phase 4: Security & Edge Cases (2-3 days)
1. Security vulnerability tests
2. Error boundary testing
3. Rate limiting verification
4. Data validation tests

## Testing Checklist Before Launch

### Must-Have Tests
- [ ] All authentication flows work correctly
- [ ] Payment processing is reliable
- [ ] Multi-tenant data isolation is bulletproof
- [ ] Core user journeys complete successfully
- [ ] API endpoints handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Third-party service failures don't crash the app

### Nice-to-Have Tests
- [ ] Component unit tests for UI consistency
- [ ] Visual regression tests
- [ ] Accessibility tests
- [ ] Performance optimization tests
- [ ] Browser compatibility tests

## Estimated Timeline

**Minimum viable testing**: 8-10 days
- 2 days: Fix existing tests and infrastructure
- 4 days: Write critical path tests
- 2 days: Integration and E2E tests
- 1-2 days: Bug fixes from test findings

**Comprehensive testing**: 15-20 days
- Includes security, performance, and edge case testing
- Achieves 80%+ code coverage
- Includes visual and accessibility testing

## Conclusion

The current testing coverage is **insufficient for a production launch**. While the infrastructure is in place, actual test implementation is minimal. The highest priority should be fixing existing tests and adding coverage for authentication, payment processing, and core user journeys.

**Risk Level**: HIGH - Launching without proper test coverage risks:
- Payment processing failures
- Data leakage between tenants  
- Authentication vulnerabilities
- Poor user experience from untested flows
- Difficulty debugging production issues

**Recommendation**: Dedicate at least 8-10 days to testing before any production launch.
