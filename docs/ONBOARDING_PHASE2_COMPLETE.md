# Phase 2: Industry Selection - Complete ✅

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added `industry` field to Site model (default: "general")
- Added `industryConfirmed` boolean to track user confirmation
- Added `gbpLocationId` to link back to Google Business Profile
- Added `gbpLastSync` for future syncing capabilities

### 2. Created IndustrySelector Component
**File**: `/app/onboarding/components/IndustrySelector.tsx`

**Features**:
- Visual selection of 7 industries with icons and descriptions
- Shows detected industry with a special badge
- Clean, accessible UI with radio buttons
- Confirmation state handling

**Industries Supported**:
- Landscaping & Lawn Care
- HVAC (Heating & Cooling)
- Plumbing
- Cleaning Services
- Electrical
- Roofing
- General Services

### 3. Updated Onboarding Flow
- Added new step: `industry-select`
- Updated progress indicator to show 3 steps
- BusinessConfirmation now passes control to industry selection
- Site creation happens after industry is confirmed

### 4. Modified BusinessConfirmation
- Changed from creating site immediately to confirming details
- Button now says "Continue to Industry Selection"
- Passes detected industry to the parent component
- Removed site creation logic (moved to onboarding page)

### 5. Enhanced Site Dashboard
- Shows selected industry with confirmation badge
- Industry visible in both individual site and sites listing
- Uses Briefcase icon for industry display

## How The Flow Works Now

1. **Step 1**: User selects their Google Business Profile
2. **Step 2**: Reviews business information (BusinessConfirmation)
3. **Step 3**: Confirms or changes detected industry (NEW!)
4. **Site Creation**: Happens after industry selection with confirmed industry

## Industry Detection Logic

The system detects industry from Google Business Profile categories:
```javascript
- "landscap" or "lawn" → Landscaping
- "hvac", "heating", or "cooling" → HVAC
- "plumb" → Plumbing
- "clean" → Cleaning
- "roof" → Roofing
- "electric" → Electrical
- Default → General
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear Visual Feedback**:
   - Detected industry shown with badge
   - Selected industry highlighted
   - Progress indicator shows current step

2. **Flexibility**:
   - Users can override auto-detected industry
   - Back button to return to previous step
   - Industry confirmation stored in database

3. **Industry-Specific Benefits**:
   - Sets foundation for industry-specific templates
   - Enables targeted features per industry
   - Improves SEO with industry categorization

## Database Changes Applied

```prisma
model Site {
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  // Industry
  industry          String   @default("general")
  industryConfirmed Boolean  @default(false)
  gbpLocationId     String?  // Track source GBP
  gbpLastSync       DateTime? // For future syncing
  
  // ... rest of model ...
}
```

## Testing the New Flow

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Sign in and go to `/onboarding`
3. Select a Google Business Profile
4. Review business details and click "Continue to Industry Selection"
5. Confirm or change the detected industry
6. Site is created with the selected industry
7. Check dashboard to see industry displayed

## Benefits Achieved

✅ **Better UX**: Clear 3-step process with visual progress
✅ **Data Quality**: Industry is always confirmed by user

## Next Steps (Phase 3)
